# TodoMatic
Using the single page web application a user may add, edit, and delete tasks they want to work on; they may also mark tasks as complete without deleting them.


[Original MDN Project](https://github.com/mdn/todo-react).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


## User Story
As a user, I can:
- read a list of tasks.
- add a task using the mouse or keyboard
- mark any task as completed, using the mouse or keyboard
- delete any task, using the mouse or keyboard
- edit any task, using the mouse or keyboard
- view a specific subset of tasks: All tasks, only the active task, or only the completed tasks.
